# Python Practice 🐍

This repository contains my Python practice programs as I learn step by step.  
I’m organizing them by topics (loops, functions, strings, etc.).

## 📂 Folder Structure
- *loops/* → Programs using loops (factorial, Fibonacci, multiplication table, etc.)
- *functions/* → Programs using functions (greet, add numbers, etc.)
- *strings/* → String programs (palindrome, reverse string, etc.)
- *lists/* → List programs (sum of elements, max number, etc.)
- *conditionals/* → If-else based programs (odd/even, grade checker, etc.)

## 🚀 Progress
✅ Loops basics done  
✅ Palindrome program added  
🔜 More coming soon…
